- IMPROVE REFRESHES' STRUCTURE!!! (very ugly to look at, right now)
- Improving the battle scrolling system (just as bad as the main menu one)
- Fixing the new "Skull gift box" issue
- Check out Tanetane's infinite running area
- The actual OAM optimization (on a per menu basis), maybe missing battle memo
